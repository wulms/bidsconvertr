# Install R, dependencies and RStudio

## Windows

Download and install a recent [R
version](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

If you work on Windows just download
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) according to
your R-version and install it. It is required to install the packages.

Download & install
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

## Linux

``` bash
wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/r-project.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/r-project.gpg] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/r-project.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt install --no-install-recommends r-base

sudo apt install r-base-dev

sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libfontconfig1-dev
```

Install
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Then “Right-Click -\> Open With -\>Software Install” should help in
installing it.
