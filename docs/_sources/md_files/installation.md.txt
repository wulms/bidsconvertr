# Install R, dependencies and RStudio

## Windows

Install a recent [R
version](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

If you work on Windows, simply download
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) according to
your R-version and install it. It is required to install the packages.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) should be downloaded and installed.

``` bash

sudo apt update
