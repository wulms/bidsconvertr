# Advanced features

```{Note} 
This part is optional. 
You should read this if your subject-IDs are messy (have a redundant prefix, suffix, or string, for example), or if you want to rename your session-IDs.
```

This section covers the optional cleaning or extraction of subject-ID’s and renaming
of sessions.

You are prompted to decide if you wish to edit subject- and session-ID’s during the user dialog.
You can skip this step if your data was already collected with clear subject- and session-ID’s:

| **Option to select**          | **What happens?**                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No, my subject-ID's are fine. | The paths are created, subject- and session-ID's get a "sub-" and "ses-" prefix, if it isn't already there. |
| Yes                           | Set a subject-ID regular expression or set a string, prefix, suffix or regular expression, which is then removed from each subject-ID.  |


## Resources for regular expressions

For more information on regular expressions (regex) please see the
[stringR cheat
sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf)
or [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/).

Each regex set here should match to your data. 
Contact me via email or the issues in this repository if you run across any troubles.

You should have enough freedom using these two routines to clean up your filenames and gradually change and improve your regular expression.


## Useful regular expressions

The input folder name serves as the subject-ID.
In the absence of a regular expression, the subject-ID is unaltered.

### Regular expression: subject-ID 

The subject-ID is extracted from the input string using this regular expression. 
If all of your files had a well established naming convention, you could use this.

| subject-ID                   | regular expression             | described in words                            | output subject-ID |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 01234                        | [:digit:]{5}                   | 5 digits                                      | sub-01234         |
| Control2132                  | (Control\|Patient)[:digit:]{4} | "Control" OR "Patient" followed by 4 digits   | sub-Control2132   |
| Patient0123_test             | (Control\|Patient)[:digit:]{4} |                                               | sub-Patient0213   |
| abcd0123                     | [:alpha:]{4}[:digit:]{4}       | 4 letters and 4 digits                        | sub-abcd0123      |
| pilot_sdfjd3222              | [:alpha:]{4}[:digit:]{4}       |                                               | sub-sdfjd3222     |
| adc932d                      | [:alnum:]{5,7}                 | between 5 to 7 alphanumeric (letters, digits) | sub-adc932d       |
| 23d49                        | [:alnum:]{5,7}                 |                                               | sub-23d49         |

Examples of subject-ID regular expressions

### Regular expression: pattern to remove

The `pattern_to_remove` regular expression simply removes the regular expression(s) from the subject-ID.

| subject-ID                   | regular expression              | described in words                                   | output subject-ID |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 02313_bidirect               | \_(bidirect\|BiDirect\|Bidiect) | "\_" followed by "bidirect", "BiDirect" or "BiDiect" | sub-02313         |
| 03211_BiDirect               | \_(bidirect\|BiDirect\|Bidiect) |                                                      | sub-03211         |
| 02111_Bidiect                | \_(bidirect\|BiDirect\|Bidiect) |                                                      | sub-02111         |
| test0111                     | test\|study_a\_                 | "test" or "study_a\_"                                | sub-0111          |
| study_a\_1111                | test\|study_a\_                 |                                                      | sub-1111          |
| pre9222post                  | pre\|post\|suffix\|prefix       | as in the cell above                                 | sub-9222          |
| suffix223prefix              | pre\|post\|suffix\|prefix       |                                                      | sub-223           |

## Do you want to edit your session-ID’s?

Your session-IDs can now be edited. 
You can choose to keep them or rename them.

| Option to select              | What happens?                                                           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes, I need to change them    | Each session is opened separately and you can enter the new session-ID. |
| No, my session-ID’s are fine. | Nothing is edited, you keep your session-IDs                            |

Yes:

| session-ID (old) | session-ID (user input) | session-BIDS |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| baseline         | 1                       | ses-1        |
| follow_up        | 2                       | ses-2        |

“Yes, I need to change them” can result in output like this. The user
could also choose to use “followup” or something else.

No:

| session-ID (old) | session-BIDS  |
|------------------|---------------|
| baseline         | ses-baseline  |
| follow_up        | ses-follow_up |

“No, my session-ID’s are fine”
