## Aim

[BIDSconvertR](https://github.com/wulms/bidsconvertr) aims to provide a workflow that can:

-   convert DICOM data to NIfTI data using
    [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)
-   structure this data according to the [BIDS
    specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    -   verify the sequence-ID’s
    -   make it simple to access the
        [BIDS-Validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/)
        (Website/Docker)
-   make available the [papayaWidget](https://github.com/muschellij2/papayaWidget) viewer
    for inspecting the images
-   allow continuous application during data collection in ongoing
    studies

## Features

Unclean subject-ID’s or session-ID’s can be renamed.

When new files or sequences are added, the 'sequence mapper' reopens until everything is declared in accordance with BIDS. 
Files that have already been processed are bypassed.

```{note} 
Only the metadata contained within the BIDS folder is free of potentially identifiable information. Follow the legal terms when sharing your dataset and consider additional defacing, pseudonymization, or both.
```
