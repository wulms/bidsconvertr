The goal of BIDSconvertR is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of BIDSconvertR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
install.packages("BIDSconvertR")
```

Please install the following packages manually:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("muschellij2/papayaWidget")
```

Please install your needed version of dcm2nii using:

```{r}
install_dcm2niix("v1.0.20211006")
```






<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(BIDSconvertR) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
